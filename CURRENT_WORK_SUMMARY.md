# Current Work Summary - Triepod.AI Website Update

## Task Overview
Updating the Triepod.AI website to replace placeholder projects with ToolNexusMCP content, as requested by the user who indicated that ToolNexusMCP.com should be referenced instead of the current placeholder projects.

## What is ToolNexusMCP?
Based on memory search, ToolNexusMCP is a comprehensive ecosystem for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that includes:
- **ToolNexusMCP.com**: A React-based directory featuring 350+ MCP servers
- **ToolNexusMCP Framework**: A TypeScript-first framework for building MCP tools
- **Multi-Database Architecture**: Uses Neo4j, ChromaDB, and Qdrant
- **Various MCP Plugins**: Sequential Thinking, Brave Search, Filesystem, Git, and more

## Changes Being Made

### 1. Blog Post Updates
- **Creating/Updating**: "Building Multi-Database AI Systems: The ToolNexusMCP Architecture"
  - Replacing generic content with specific ToolNexusMCP implementation details
  - Highlighting the three-database architecture (Neo4j, Qdrant, ChromaDB)
  - Adding real code examples and technical insights

### 2. Project Showcase Updates
- Replacing placeholder "AI Code Assistant" with ToolNexusMCP
- Updating project descriptions to reflect actual ToolNexusMCP capabilities
- Adding links to the live site (https://toolnexusmcp.com)

### 3. Technical Details Being Added
- **Neo4j**: Knowledge graph for mapping MCP server relationships
- **Qdrant**: Semantic search across documentation and code
- **ChromaDB**: Sequential reasoning for configuration generation
- **350+ MCP Servers**: Real metric from the actual system
- **Cross-client support**: Claude Desktop, WindSurf, and Cline

## Current Status
- ✅ Found ToolNexusMCP information in memory systems
- ✅ Verified the website is live at https://toolnexusmcp.com
- 🔄 Currently updating blog posts with ToolNexusMCP content
- ⏳ Next: Update project pages and homepage references

2. `/app/blog/page.tsx` - Blog listing page (pending)
3. `/app/projects/` - Project showcase pages (pending)
4. `/app/page.tsx` - Homepage project references (pending)

## Key Information Preserved
- Maintaining the "secret sauce" approach - not revealing proprietary methodologies
- Focusing on architecture and results rather than implementation details
- Highlighting the scale (350+ servers) and technical innovation
- Keeping Bryan Thompson's story and disability rights focus in appropriate sections

## Next Steps
