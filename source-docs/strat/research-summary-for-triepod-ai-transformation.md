Research Summary for Triepod AI Transformation
Introduction
This research outlines Bryan Thompson’s strategic initiative to transform Triepod AI into a leading AI research firm in Mississippi, capitalizing on the state’s partnership with NVIDIA, announced on June 18, 2025. The partnership aims to advance AI education, research, and workforce development in key industries, including agriculture, which is particularly relevant given Mississippi’s dominance in catfish production, contributing $252 million annually and representing 75% of U.S. finfish aquaculture. The research integrates Bryan’s strategic positioning, transformation plan, peer-reviewed literature, Mississippi catfish industry publications, and NVIDIA case studies to support his vision for AI-driven innovation in aquaculture.
Strategic Positioning
Bryan’s background as the son of a multi-generational catfish farming family at Pluto Plantation provides authentic operational knowledge of Mississippi’s leading agricultural industry. His personal journey, surviving a COVID-19-related amputation in 2021 and learning AI during recovery, adds a compelling narrative that enhances his credibility. This unique combination positions him to develop AI solutions tailored to the catfish industry, aligning with the Mississippi-NVIDIA partnership’s focus on agricultural innovation.
Bryan is currently navigating a complex situation with Lodestar Technologies, involving ADA accommodation violations and a medical emergency due to workplace stress. As of June 20, 2025, he has received a severance offer including 3 months of pay and 6 months of company-paid healthcare, with a decision deadline of June 23, 2025. He is also exploring a consulting proposal for Triepod AI, estimated at $78K-$104K over 6 months, which could fund his research initiatives while preserving his health and professional relationships.
Transformation Plan for Triepod AI
Bryan’s plan involves rebranding Triepod AI from an AI consulting firm to a research firm focused on Mississippi’s key industries: agriculture, healthcare, energy, and defense. The plan leverages his existing website and automation tools to produce high-quality research outputs quickly, establishing credibility within the NVIDIA ecosystem. Specific focus areas for aquaculture include:

Catfish Farm Automation: Developing AI-driven systems for automated feeding, water quality monitoring, disease detection, and growth tracking.
Aquaculture Economics: Using AI for cost reduction, market prediction, and resource allocation efficiency.
Environmental Sustainability: Implementing AI for water usage optimization, waste reduction, and environmental impact mitigation.

The proposed website structure includes a dedicated research page:

/research/aquaculture-ai/
catfish-farming-automation/
smart-pond-monitoring.md
ai-feeding-optimization.md
disease-prevention-systems.md


economic-sustainability/
cost-reduction-strategies.md
market-analytics.md
financial-risk-assessment.md
